# Description
This is a script that let's the player have a useable boombox item in their inventory and use it to play songs/sounds.

# Usage
Add song mp3/ogg files to the xyz-3dsounds resource, and add them to the qb-boombox config. In its current state, the menu will only display the tapes/songs that you have available in your inventory, via GetPlayerData().items in the client.

I have included a pdn template file I've used to create tape/song inventory images, using real covers, and an example of one of them.

This script currently uses my own version of qb-menu, xyz-3dsound, and mnm_notify as dependencies. The latter 2 are available on github, and I will probably release qb-menu soon.
